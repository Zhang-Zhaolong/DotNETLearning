1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
Use String when dealing with small, immutable text or concatenation is minimal. Strings in C# are immutable, meaning any modification creates a new object in memory.
Use StringBuilder when performing multiple modifications (concatenation, insertions, deletions, etc.) on strings, as it is mutable and more efficient.
2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
The base class for all arrays in C# is System.Array.
3. How do you sort an array in C#?
Use the Array.Sort() method
4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
Use the Length property
5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
No
6. What’s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
CopyTo()	Copies elements to another existing array. Requires an already initialized destination array.
Clone()	Creates a shallow copy of the array, returning a new array with the same elements.
